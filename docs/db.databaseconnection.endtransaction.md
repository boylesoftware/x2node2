## DatabaseConnection.endTransaction() method

End database transaction.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
endTransaction(res: TxResolve): Promise<void>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  res | <code>TxResolve</code> | Transaction resolution. |

<b>Returns:</b>

`Promise<void>`

Promise that resolves when transaction is successfully ended and rejects if there was an error attempting to end the transaction.

## Remarks

If `resolve` is [TxResolve.Commit](./db.txresolve.commit.md)<!-- -->, throws an error if there is no active transaction associated with this connection (considered a programming error). Rollback is the same, but is allowed to be performed after an unsuccessful commit.

Once <em>successfully</em> ended, a new transaction can be started on the same connection, or the connenction can be released.

Connection can be released after a rollback even if it was unsuccessful. Normally, if transaction rollback was unsuccessful, releasing the connection destroys it (even if connection pool is utilized).
