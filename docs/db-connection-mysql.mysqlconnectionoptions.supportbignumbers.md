## MySQLConnectionOptions.supportBigNumbers property

Determines if numbers returned from the database that do not fit in JavaScript's `Number` are represented as strings instead.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
supportBigNumbers?: false;
```

## Remarks

The framework relies on numbers to be always represented as `Number` instances. Therefore, this option must be `false` or omitted. Use string (or other) data types to represent numeric values that can be large enough to not fit in a `Number`<!-- -->.
