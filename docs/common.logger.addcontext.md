## Logger.addContext() method

Create new logger based on this one and add context to it.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
addContext(ctx: string[]): Logger;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  ctx | <code>string[]</code> | Additional context items. |

<b>Returns:</b>

`Logger`

Contextualized logger.

## Remarks

Log message format may include information about context, in which the logged event took place. Context is application specific list of short items, such as current API request id, current transaction id, etc. Creating a contextualized logger is cheap, because it still uses the parent logger for all the main functionality. Once the context is no more relevant, the contextualized logger can be simply thrown away. A contextualized logger itself can be used to create furhter contextualized loggers. These loggers will include the parent logger's context, plus their own.
