## Application.shutdown() method

Gracefully shutdown the application.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
shutdown(): Promise<void>;
```
<b>Returns:</b>

`Promise<void>`

Promise the resolves when the shutdown is complete (that is when all application services complete shutdown). The promise never rejects since all shutdown errors are logged, but otherwise ignored.

## Remarks

Once called, the application starts shutting down all of its services in the reverse initialization order. Any errors encountered during services shutdown are logged, but otherwise ignored.

If [Application.shutdown()](./common.application.shutdown.md) is called when the application is already shutting down, the same shutdown promise will be returned. This, however, should not be normal application behavior. A corresponding warning message will be logged in the console.

It is safe to call [Application.shutdown()](./common.application.shutdown.md) on an uninitialized application or application that has been shut down. The returned promise will resolve immediately.

It is also possible to call [Application.shutdown()](./common.application.shutdown.md) while the application is being initialized via the [Application.init()](./common.application.init.md) method. In that case, the initialization process will be aborted, all services already initialized will be shut down.
