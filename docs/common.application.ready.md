## Application.ready property

Tells if the application has been successfully initialized and is ready to be used.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
readonly ready: boolean;
```

## Remarks

When a new application instance is created, this flag is initially `false`<!-- -->. It becomes `true` after the application is successfully initialized (see [Application.init()](./common.application.init.md) method). When the application is shutting down or has shut down (see [Application.shutdown()](./common.application.shutdown.md)<!-- -->), this flag turns back to `false`<!-- -->.
