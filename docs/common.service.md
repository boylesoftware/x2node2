<b>Signature:</b>

export interface Service 
```

## Properties

|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [shutdownDependencies](./common.service.shutdowndependencies.md) | <code>ServiceKey&lt;unknown&gt;[]</code> | List of services (identified by their service keys) that may not be shut down before this service completes its shutdown. |

## Methods
