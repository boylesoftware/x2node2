## DatabaseConnection.release() method

Release connection back to the connection provider.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
release(): void;
```
<b>Returns:</b>

`void`

## Remarks

The connection object is no longer usable after this method call.

If there is an active transaction associated with the connection (see [DatabaseConnection.beginTransaction()](./db.databaseconnection.begintransaction.md) method), the connection cannot be released until the transaction is ended. This method throws an error and the application crashes (considered a programming error) if attempted.

Note to implementors: throwing an error from this method normally leads to the application crash.
