## Service.shutdown() method

Gracefully shutdown the service.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
shutdown?(): Promise<void> | void;
```
<b>Returns:</b>

`Promise<void> | void`

Nothing, if service shuts down synchronously, or, for asynchronous shutdown, a promise that resolves when the service shutdown is complete.

## Remarks

Thrown errors and rejected promises are logged, but otherwise ignored. The service is removed from the application and the shutdown process continues.
